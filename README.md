## Overview

The purpose of project is to analysis the New York City Citibike data from August 2019 in order to determine if Citibikes would be a good fit for Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis was based on user time, time by gender, Trips by Gender(Weekday per hour),Trips by Weekday per hour and user trip by gender per weekday.Before the begun of the analysis it was required to used Pandas to change the 'tripduration' column from an integer to a datetime datatype. 

The report consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present my results. 

  Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

  Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

  Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results

###   Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

By using Python and Pandas functions, I converted the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00).
