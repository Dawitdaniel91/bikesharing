## Overview

The analysis was based on user time, time by gender, Trips by Gender(Weekday per hour),Trips by Weekday per hour and user trip by gender per weekday.Before the begun of the analysis it was required to used Pandas to change the 'tripduration' column from an integer to a datetime datatype. 

The report consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present my results. 

  Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

  Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

  Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results

 ### Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
 
 Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:
 
. How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.

. How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.

. A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by typeof user and gender.

Most of the users used the high demand for weekend hours are middle of the day between 10 am and 6 pm.

## Summery

  Based the chart analysis the males are the primary users of City bikes in New York City if we see the general usertype, but if we see only the customers usertype, the difference is not significant because we do not have any information regarding the unknown customers. If we see the subscribersâ€™ numbers, we can conclude the overall males are most of the usertype of the city bikes in the New York City. But Additional analysis is needed in order to determine if City bikes is a great fit for Des Moines, Iowa.
  
  
  In order to determine if city bikes are good fit for Des Moines, there is still some more visualization needed to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. There are two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis
  
  
  The first one, it is better to visualize population growths between Des Moines and New York City. Publicly available census data could be used to look at population totals and growth rates between the two cities. The other one is visualization  based on the weather data between Des Moines and New York City.
