## Overview

The purpose of project is to analysis the New York City Citibike data from August 2019 in order to determine if Citibikes would be a good fit for Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis was based on user time, time by gender, Trips by Gender(Weekday per hour),Trips by Weekday per hour and user trip by gender per weekday.Before the begun of the analysis it was required to used Pandas to change the 'tripduration' column from an integer to a datetime datatype. 

The report consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present my results. 

  Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

  Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

  Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results

###   Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

By using Python and Pandas functions, I converted the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00).

 ### Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
 
 Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:
 
. How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.

. How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.

. A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by typeof user and gender.


 ### Checkout Times for Users
 
 In this visualization, The graph shows us the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.
